\abstract{
	Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods achieve substantial efficiency gains by replacing independent and identically distributed (IID) random points by low discrepancy (LD) points.  LD point generators and QMC algorithms are active research areas.  Practitioners are attracted to QMC by the promise of  efficiency gains.
	
	This tutorial highlights several readily available QMC software libraries in various languages.  We describe the components of a QMC calculation:  the LD point generators, problem specification, methods for speeding up the computation, and stopping criteria.  We argue that excellent QMC software requires the collaboration of a community---not only the efforts of individual research groups.  
	
	During this tutorial we provide hands-on experience with QMCPy \cite{QMCPy}, a Python 3 library that draws on the work of several experts \cite{GAIL,GilesSoftware,QRNG,LatBuild,MPS,OwenHalton}.  We do this through the Google Colaboratory notebook at https://tinyurl.com/QMCPyTutorial.  QMCPy grew out of discussions held at MCQMC 2018.  Minimal experience with QMC or Python is assumed.
